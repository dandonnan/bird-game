# Bird Game
Developed by Dan Donnan using MonoGame. Bird Game can be downloaded from [itch](https://dandonnan.itch.io/bird-game).

## About
Bird Game was developed in less than 30 hours as a challenge to see if I was still capable of making a game on my own given how I haven't done it for so long. It is rough around the edges, and some things don't work as intended, but this source code is available as it is a simple game and may help new developers with their own games.
